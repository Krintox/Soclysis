# Social Network Analysis Tool

Welcome to the Social Network Analysis Tool! This tool allows you to create and analyze social networks, track friendships, and analyze user interactions.

## Features

- **User Management**: Add and remove users from the social network.
- **Friendship Management**: Form and dissolve friendships between users.
- **Post Management**: Users can create posts, like, share, and comment on posts.
- **Subscription**: Users can subscribe to other users to follow their activities.
- **Followers Analysis**: Analyze the count of followers for each user in the network.

## Algorithms and Concepts Used

- **Graph Representation**: The social network is represented as a graph, with users as nodes and friendships as edges.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Used to find mutual friends between two users.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes lists, maps, and arrays to manage users, friendships, and posts efficiently.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implemented using Java's object-oriented features to encapsulate user behavior and interactions.

## Sample Input

Here's a sample input sequence you can provide to interact with the tool:
1<br>
Krintox<br>
1<br>
Shashank<br>
1<br>
Suggala<br>
3<br>
Krintox Shashank<br>
3<br>
Krintox SUggala<br>
3<br>
Shashank Suggala<br>
5<br>
6<br>

This sequence adds three users (Krintox, Shashank, and Suggala), forms friendships between them, analyzes the followers count, and then exits the program.
